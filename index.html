            <h2>What is Lorem Ipsum?</h2>
            <p><strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong> 
                is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting <br>
                industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy <br>
                text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley <br>
                of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has <br>
                survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic <br>
                typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in <br>
                the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem <br> 
                Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing <br>
                software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

        <div style="float: right;">
                <h2>Why do we use it?</h2>
                <p>
                    It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the <br>
                    readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of <br>
                    using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution <br>
                    of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', <br>
                    making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing <br>
                    packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their <br>
                    default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover <br>
                    many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved <br>
                    over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose <br>
                    (injected humour and the like).

             <h2>Where does it come from?</h2>
             <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. <br>
                 It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, <br>
                 making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin <br>
                 professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of <br>
                 the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum <br>
                 passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical <br>
                 literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum <br>
                 comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum <br>
                 et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in <br>
                 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular <br> 
                 during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem <br>
                 ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32. <br>
                 
                The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is <br>
                reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and <br>
                1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also <br>
                reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English <br>
                versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.

        <h2>Where can I get some?</h2>
        <p>
            There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, <br>
            but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected <br>
            humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly <br>
            believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you <br>
            need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the <br>
            middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet <br>
            tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the <br>
            first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 <br> 
            Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence <br>
            structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The <br>
            generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, <br>
            injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.
